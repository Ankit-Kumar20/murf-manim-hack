      prompt: `Break down the topic "${topic}" into 3-4 sequential mini-lessons for educational animation.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Each lesson should be 15 seconds long
2. Narration script must be â‰¤70 words (fits in 15 seconds of speech)
3. Manim code must use ONLY: Write, FadeIn, FadeOut, Transform
4. Maximum 3-4 animations per scene
5. Set run_time so total scene duration is 15 seconds
6. Each scene class named Part1, Part2, Part3, etc.
7. Lessons must flow naturally from one to the next

MANIM CODE RULES:
- Use 'from manim import *' as only import
- Create Scene class that inherits from Scene
- Include construct method with complete animation logic
- Use proper 4-space indentation
- Add self.wait() calls for proper timing
- Keep animations lightweight and fast
- Focus on visual clarity over complexity

LESSON FLOW:
- Part 1: Introduction and basic definition
- Part 2: Key mechanism or process
- Part 3: Applications or implications
- Part 4 (optional): Advanced concepts or future directions

Make each part build naturally on the previous one while being understandable independently.
