# OpenRouter Integration Summary

## Changes Made

This document summarizes the changes made to integrate OpenRouter for Manim code generation instead of using Google AI SDK directly.

### Files Modified

1. **`src/utils/structuredManimGenerator.ts`**
   - Replaced `@ai-sdk/google` import with `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`
   - Updated model from `google('gemini-1.5-flash')` to `openrouter("google/gemini-flash-1.5")`
   - Added OpenRouter provider initialization

2. **`src/utils/lessonBreakdown.ts`**
   - Replaced `@ai-sdk/google` import with `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`
   - Updated model from `google("gemini-1.5-flash")` to `openrouter("google/gemini-flash-1.5")`
   - Added OpenRouter provider initialization

3. **`src/utils/voiceNarration.ts`**
   - Replaced `@ai-sdk/google` import with `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`
   - Updated model from `google('gemini-1.5-flash')` to `openrouter("google/gemini-flash-1.5")`
   - Added OpenRouter provider initialization

4. **`.env.example`**
   - Updated to include `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` configuration
   - Removed deprecated `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
   - Added better documentation for all required environment variables

5. **`README.md`**
   - Updated tech stack to reflect OpenRouter usage
   - Updated prerequisites and environment setup instructions
   - Updated API key requirements

### Benefits of OpenRouter Integration

1. **Model Flexibility**: OpenRouter provides access to multiple AI models through a single API
2. **Cost Optimization**: Can switch between different models based on cost and performance needs
3. **Reliability**: Improved reliability through OpenRouter's infrastructure
4. **Consistency**: All AI-powered features now use the same provider

### Environment Variables Required

```env
# Primary AI provider for code generation
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here

# Text-to-speech for voice narration
MURF_AI_API_KEY=your_murf_ai_api_key_here

# Code execution sandbox
E2B_API_KEY=your_e2b_api_key_here

# File storage for caching
BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_vercel_blob_token_here
```

### Model Configuration

The integration uses `google/gemini-flash-1.5` through OpenRouter, which provides:
- Fast response times suitable for real-time applications
- Good performance for code generation tasks
- Cost-effective pricing structure

### Testing

To test the integration:
1. Set up your OpenRouter API key in environment variables
2. Run the development server: `bun dev`
3. Try generating Manim code through the application
4. Verify that lesson breakdown and voice narration features work correctly

The changes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality while providing better flexibility for future AI model selections.
